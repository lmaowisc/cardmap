-   **Aim 1: Acquire age and gender specific reference ranges.**
    -   Following SCMR recommendations, upper and lower range of normal will be defined by the mean plus and minus 2 standard deviations of the normal data, respectively. 

-   **Aim 2: Evaluate the performance of different relaxometry methods.**
    -   To assess and quantify the test-retest repeatability within sequence, and between-system, between-sequence, and between-reconstruction reproducibility for T1 and T2 mapping as described in Aim 2 subgoals, three metrics (ICC, repeatability/reproducibility coefficient, bias) will be estimated for each pairwise comparison.
