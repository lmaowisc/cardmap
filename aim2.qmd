Age- and gender-specific upper and lower ranges within each slice were calculated as the mean plus and minus 2 standard deviations of the normal data, respectively. Differences by age, gender, and slice were assessed by three-way repeated measures ANOVA. Repeatability and reproducibility were assessed by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) [@fleiss1971], repeatability/reproducibiliy coefficient, and Bland-Altman analysis. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed in R version 4.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
